* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**<br>
 The origins of FTX specifically are interesting in that the founders came across a market oportunity within bitcoin trading in that there was a significant arbitrage to be had between the US and Asian markets, specifically Korea and Japan. This was known at the time as the Kimchi Premium. They made about $20 million from this strategy. [[1]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html)

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**<br>
The company was largely self funded at the very onset. However 6 months after launch, the founder of the worlds largest crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), Changpeng “CZ” Zhao bought a 20% stake in the company for $100 million. FTX was then successful the following year in raising over $18 billion from a number of high profile venture capital and private equity firms. Within three years of its inception the firm was valued at over $32 Billion. [[2]](https://www.ft.com/content/a3a90a4f-54e4-4b4f-b1df-2d9d8ca7712d) The company then moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas.

## Business Activities

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**<br>
The company was largely trying to become the premier, consumer and institutionally friendly, crypto exchange with offerings of sophisticated trading instruments, NFT trading, as well as traditional finance stock trading. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**<br>
FTX went on a marketing blitzkrieg. They targeted many celebrities such as Tom Brady, personal finance podcast titans like Grahm Stephen, and hollywood names like Larry David. There was a hilariously ironic commercial played at a superbowl in which Larry doubts technological advancements throughout history.[[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWMnbJJpeZc)



* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**<br>
Well on the surface the company was actually a great exchange. They had a very polished platform that made the 'on ramp' and 'off ramp' of getting money into crypto currency easy. Because the company was so well funded they could afford the technology to be developed in ways others couldnt afford. SBF was the golden boy in the crypto space. He had the ear of many large investors as well as inroads into the political sphere. He had been working closely with politicians in the US about drafting legislation for better regulation of cryptocurrency. The unfair (and ultimately illegal) advantage was that the company had zero financial controls, Sam had god-tier powers to move money in any way he saw it. 

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)**<br>
As of about two weeks ago the company is no longer using any technology, as they have declared Chapter 11 bankruptsy. However they likely employed all the tools we will be learning about in this course. 
[One rather interesting peice of tech the company deployed was actually illegal.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-secret-software-change-allowed-ftx-use-client-money-2022-12-13/) It allowed the hedge fund and SBF himself to be immune from the auto trading code closing out large loss positions.

## Landscape

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**<br>
They were been in the consumer and insitutional cryptocurrency exchange business. The company also engaged in both proprietary trading and  policy influence and lobbying in Washington DC. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?**<br>
This has been likely the most dynamic industry in the last 10 years. With the release of the bitcoin white paper[[4]](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) on October 31 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sparked a fire that has been blazing for the last decade. In the begining, crypto was nothing more than *fake internet money* in the minds of most people. It caught on due to its restrictionless nature as well as the psudoanonymity. The major paradim shift that bitcoin and blockchain brought to the table were trustless, publicly verifiable transactions without a central party. This was an innovation that has disrupted the financial system that has been in place for more than a centry.  Specifically what FTX brought to the table that few others have and many companies struggle with is breaking the barrier to law makers. SBF had some strong inroads to the political world and regardless if his intentions were self serving, he was skillful at garnering the favor of politicans in the US. In the coming years we will likely see much change in the legislative space.

As the worlds largest crypto exchange, Binance has a huge reach. They have services ranging from education tools for beginners to highly sophisticated and even automated trading api integration for institutional customers to platforms helping entrepeneurs launch crypto businesses. Their founder CZ ultimately was bought out of his stake in FTX netting the company about $2bln in profit. Calls have been made for him to donate this back to customers FTX hurt[[6]](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/15/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-brushes-off-2-billion-ftx-clawback-concerns-fraud.html).

## Results
<br>

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**<br>
It had a meteoric rise and seemed untouchable. They had stadiums named after them, celebrities, and a young energetic staff, and then lost it all. Customers in the US had to trade on a seperate platform from the rest of the world FTX.us vs FTX.com and accordingly have been largely safeguarded from what happened. In short what happened is that there were two terms of service but all customers were secretly treated the same:
1. Sophisticated customers who were trading on margin[[7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) were able to leverage their positions up to 20X meaning for every $100 you could trade up to a notional $2000! Their portfolios carried additional risk of being lent out to make extra returns.
2. Basic customers who had a standard trading account, were told that they had zero lending risk and their account was essentially a savings account unless they chose to trade the funds. 

Bottom line is that this didnt happen. All the funds were pooled and when a 'run on the bank'[[8]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp) happened so to speak, the basic customers had their funds given to the faster-to-withdraw margin trading customers. 


* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**<br>

Transparency has been one of the hallmarks of Cryptocurrency since its inception. Because the blockchain is a publicly verifiable ledger part of its magic is that anyone can see any transaction on the chain. BlockExplorer[[9]](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) is a wonderful tool that allows you to look anything up, just like a search engine for block data.

Charity has also been something at the forefront of the crypto industry. Encouraged by the borderless nature of the technology, various crypto charities have sprung up specifically utilizing cryptocurrency. Binance has a great page outlining all the work they have done in the charity space.[[10]](https://www.binance.charity/)

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**<br>
Complete Failure. They had a hyper-complex organizational structure that did not allow for any transparency which ultimately allowed them to defraud people for as long as they did.

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**<br> 
Something that today is still hard to track even with all the block exploring tools is complete and utter transparency of a customers account on the blockchain. While the other big exchanges still obfuscate where your funds actually live, at least you can see some of the trail. If I were opening a crypto exchange I would allow for COMPLETE transparency for each individual account and permit the customers to view the transactions from A to Z. 


* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**<br>
It would increase the trust, which is badly needed in the crypto industry. 


* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**<br>
Blockchain is the backbone of any crypto company. I personally think that the ethereum blockchain[[11]](https://ethereum.org/en/) and its layer 2 and layer 3 scaling solutions will provide a robust environment for the future developments[[12]](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) that happen on Web3. 
* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** <br>
Web3 will be the decentralization of the internet. Today's internet giants will no longer have the power to say what should and should not be allowed. Building the future of the internet on things like the ethereum blockchain and its downstream derivitives will change that. [[13]](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/)
